    "brief": `Built this project as a part of Engineering Practicum course under the guidance of <i><a href="http://www.iitp.ac.in/~athakur" target="_blank">Dr. Atul Thakur</a></i> and <i><a href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/~aashwani/" target="_blank">Dr. Ashwani Assam</a></i> in my junior year`,
    "description": ['Studied and demonstrated the basic motions and mechanics of a drone on <strong>Coppelia Sim</strong>', 'Used Parrot AR Drone for our research and controlled it using the <strong>NodeJS</strong> library', 'Connected the drone with our console and processed the images and videos captured from the droneâ€™s camera to detect various colours using <strong>Python OpenCV</strong> in real-time', 'Integrated  <strong>U-blox GPS sensor, NRF-24l01 Wifi module and Arduino Nano<strong> with the drone to send the coordinates during its flight for real-time tracking. Designed a protective case for the sensors on <strong>Solidworks</strong> and fabricated it using 3D printer', 'Also processed the images and videos obtained during its flight to <strong>create a 2D map of the region using the OpenCV image stitcher class</strong>. It uses the ORB algorithm for Image Stitching and derives its primary motivation from SIFT algorithm. ORB is a fusion of the FAST key point detector and BRIEF descriptor with some modifications','Developed a <strong>machine-learning model capable of detecting various objects</strong>. Trained our model to detect bicycles and tested it on the videos obtained from the drone. The model worked with almost <strong>70% accuracy</strong>','Extending this project to the final year BTP wherein we shall design external drone covers of various shapes and sizes and carry out <strong>CFD analysis on Ansys Fluent</strong> to estimate the drag force on it. It aims at reducing the drag force experienced by consignment delivery drones, which will ultimately help in <strong>reducing fuel consumption</strong>'],
